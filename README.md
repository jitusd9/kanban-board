# Kanban Board

> Kanban Board is used to manage work personally or professionally in which we use cards to represent tasks and columns to represent process.

this particular is a pet project which is why It has minimum features I have built this using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) This project has two versions  

1. No login version uses browser [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store data in browser
2. other one uses [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store online and the user needs to signup for that
